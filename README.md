# Fandango_movieratings
• Analyzed the Fandango movie ratings dataset to find if there is a bias towards rating movies better, to sell more tickets. 

• Explored the scores displayed by Fandango and the true user ratings for movies and visualized the difference in distributions using seaborn in the form of KDE plots and count plots. 

• Compared the distribution of scores from Fandango to other movie rating sites like Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB and Metacritic using pandas and seaborn plots like KDE plots, Hist plots and cluster maps. 

• Documented the results of analysis and calculated the normalized scores for the movies across all platforms.
